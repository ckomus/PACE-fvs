# ILP for solving Feedback Vertex Set

To run the ILP you will need to install either CPLEX or Gurobi. The path to either
installation plus the version number must be added in the corresponding line in the Makefile.

Further variables that need to be set in the Makefile are whether or not CPLEX and GUROBI are installed, the
locations of the corresponding programs and the local CPU architecture.
